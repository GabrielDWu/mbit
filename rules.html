		<h2 class="subtitle is-4">Competition</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Any <strong>middle or high school student</strong> is eligible to participate in the competition. Students will receive a number of problems and submit solutions in <strong>Python, Java, or C++</strong> to our online grader. There is no penalty for wrong answers, runtime errors, or compilation errors. Teams are ranked based on the number of problems solved, with the last correct submission time used as a tiebreaker. Students may access reference books and the internet; however, they are encouraged to cite sources if they use code found online.</p>
			<p>If competitors believe there is an issue with the prompt or grading, they may submit an appeal form no later than 30 minutes after the end of the programming portion of the competition. Competition organizers will review all appeals and make a decision.</p>
		</div>
		<h2 class="subtitle is-4">Divisions</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>mBIT has two divisions: <strong>rookie and varsity.</strong> Middle schoolers are highly encouraged to compete as rookies, but advanced students may choose to participate in the varsity division. Students with greater than one year of competitive programming experience (USACO, Codeforces, Code Jam, etc.) are expected to compete under varsity. For more guidance on what division to choose, view the sample problems and example topics on the <a href="/">home page</a>.</p>
		</div>
		<h2 class="subtitle is-4">Conduct</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>All students are expected to <strong>behave appropriately.</strong> This includes being respectful to others, following competition rules, and just using common sense. Violation of any of these rules is grounds for disqualification from the competition.</p>
