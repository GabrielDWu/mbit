		<h2 class="subtitle is-4">Teams</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Any <strong>middle or high school student</strong> is eligible to participate in the competition. Students may compete in <strong>teams of up to four</strong> and are allowed to access reference books and the internet; however, they are encouraged to cite sources if they use code found online. Directly asking for assistance from anyone other than competition organizers is not permitted.</p>
			<p>There are two divisions: <strong>rookie and varsity.</strong> Rookie is targeted towards students with little to no competitive programming experience, with problems focusing on problem solving and implementation. Concepts include conditional statements, loops, and recursion. Problems in varsity emphasize algorithmic complexity and efficiency, with concepts including pathfinding, dynamic programming, and segment trees.</p>
			<p>Students with knowledge of concepts such as time complexity, graph theory, or data structures are <strong>expected to compete under varsity.</strong> The rookie division is aimed towards students currently enrolled in their first or second year of computer science classes. The sample problems on the <a href="/">home page</a> can serve as additional guidance for which division to choose.</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle is-4">Grading</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Competitors will receive a number of problems and submit solutions in <strong>Python, Java, or C++</strong> to our online grader (technical details will be added as the competition date approaches). Upon submission, teams will receive preliminary feedback on the accuracy of their program for certain test cases that are representative of the bounds of the problem. However, the results of the comprehensive test cases used for rankings will not be released to teams until the end of the competition.</p>
			<p>If there is an error in the preliminary tests, teams will receive information only on the nature of the error (runtime error, compilation error, or timeout). There is no penalty for these errors, and there is no limit on the number of submissions. Rankings are calculated based on the sum of the percentage of correct test cases for the most recent submission of each problem. This means that teams may receive partial credit for suboptimal solutions.</p>
			<p>If competitors believe there is an issue with the prompts or grading, they may submit an appeal form no later than 30 minutes after the end of the programming portion of the competition. Competition organizers will review all appeals and make a decision.</p>
		</div>
		<h2 class="subtitle is-4">Conduct</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>All students are expected to <strong>behave appropriately.</strong> This includes being respectful to others, following competition rules, and just using common sense. Violation of any of these rules is grounds for disqualification from the competition.</p>
